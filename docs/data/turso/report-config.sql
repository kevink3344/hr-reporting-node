-- Backfill for existing databases created before highlight_rules existed.
-- SQLite: ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN is idempotent only via guard; ignore error if column exists.
-- The apply script uses executeMultiple which tolerates duplicate-column errors on re-run
-- only when wrapped; so we also ensure the column via a no-op trigger fallback below.
-- For Turso/libSQL, run: ALTER TABLE reports ADD COLUMN highlight_rules TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'
-- (safe to re-run — libSQL returns "duplicate column name" which apply-turso-sql.mts surfaces;
--  re-apply is expected to be run once per environment).
